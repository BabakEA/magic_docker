Magic Docker is an automated tools to build a Docker Image


Hey there
 

You are using the Magic_Docker Tools. It is an automated python application to create an error-free Docker Image. 

Magic_docker is an automated, open-source, code-free, and customizable python library which I designed to automate the containerization process using Docker. 

I have created two training sessions to explain the Docker file and show how to use this library. 
They can be found through my youtube channel. 

Youtube channel: training session using the following links:

first part: What is the docker file and how Magic_docker is working

second part: Magic_docker implementation_ create a Docker image using magic_docker in 5 minutes.

The current version has been programmed for Linux Os if you are a Linux user, good news! Magic _docker will take care of all the steps. Please sweet yourself and enjoy the show. 
If you are a windows or MAC user, Magic docker still will help you. It will create the Dockerfile, requirements, and the shell script to build and save the created docker image. 
You need to run the shell command manually. 

Please feel free to contact me if you needed any further assistance. 

Thank you.
